# bookbot

BookBot analyses books and prints statistical reports of the word and character usage found within.

BookBot is a guided project from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev).

## Environment

BookBot requires a standard Python 3 installation.

## Usage

A call to the main Python file is required, followed by the path to the text file you wish to analyse. For example:

```console
user:~/bookbot$ python main.py <path-to-.txt-file>
```
